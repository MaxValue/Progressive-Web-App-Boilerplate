## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

A browser. :P

### Installing

Clone this project

```
git clone https://github.com/maxvalue/PWA-Boilerplate.git
```

Fill in the files, delete the `.git` directory and run

```
git init
```

The rest is git and coding.

## Deployment

You will need some basic web server to serve the files if you want people on the public web be able to use your PWA.

## Built With

* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - The code editor I use
* [Python 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) - For running the dev web server

### Project History

This code is mainly based [on Matt Knight's tutorial](http://matt.might.net/articles/how-to-native-iphone-ipad-apps-in-javascript/) about the same topic.
I also read the book "Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript_ Making App Store Apps Without Objective-C or Cocoa-O" by Jonathan Stark.
Thanks to [Matt Snider's tutorial](http://mattsnider.com/making-html5-apps-appear-native-on-ios/) I found Apple's documentation about their URL schemes.
I wanted to do such a boilerplate for a longer time now, but only since I started working on another project, Terpene-Profile-Parser-for-Cannabis-Strains, I felt compelled to write up this boilerplate.
See also another project of mine which you could combine with this boilerplate to give your web app a more mobile-platform-like look.
